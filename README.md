## The Application

Welcome to OnTrack please see published site [here](https://ci-project-5-frontend-connall-0e9d76f51490.herokuapp.com/signin)

![Intro](assets/images/Intro/responsive.jpg)

### Wireframes and features

Welcome to OnTrack, a task managing application that lets you create, edit, delete, and tick off tasks during your day. We also feature a profile section where you can change your profile image and your bio, as well as some rewards that you can track along the way.

The purpose of this project was to bring to life a task managing app that would be simple and effective to use, without having too many intricacies to work through.

We wanted to make an application that would be easy to understand right away and be useful to a potential customer.

**Sign Up**

![Wireframe SignUp SML](assets/images/SignUpPage/SignUpPage_Small_Wireframe.jpg)

![Wireframe SignUp MED](assets/images/SignUpPage/SignUpPage_Med_Wireframe.jpg)

As you can see, we kept the design fairly simple with the user only needing to add in their username and their password. We also included our logo for the application on the right-hand side so potential users could get an idea of the application right away. We also added an embedded link if the person would like to sign in instead, and a link to the about page if they wanted some more information right away.

![SignUp SML](assets/images/SignUpPage/SignUpPage_Small.jpg)

![SignUp MED](assets/images/SignUpPage/SignUpPage_Med.jpg)

![SignUp LRG](assets/images/SignUpPage/SignUpPage_Lrg.jpg)

**Sign In**

![Wireframe SignIn SML](assets/images/SignInPage/SignInPage_Small_Wireframe.jpg)

![Wireframe SignIn MED](assets/images/SignInPage/SignInPage_Medium_Wireframe.jpg)

![Wireframe SignIn LRG](assets/images/SignInPage/SignInPage_Large_Wireframe.jpg)


For the sign-in page, we also kept it simple, looking much like the sign-up page, with the two links included at the bottom.

![SignIn SML](assets/images/SignInPage/SignInPage_Small.jpg)

![SignIn MED](assets/images/SignInPage/SignInPage_Medium.jpg)

![SignIn LRG](assets/images/SignInPage/SignInPage_Large.jpg)

**About**

![Wireframe About](assets/images/AboutPage/AboutPage_Wireframe.jpg)

We added this page so the user could learn more about the app, just in case they were unsure of what our app was about. We also added this for visually impaired users; this is just a section about what you can do with our app.

![About SML](assets/images/AboutPage/AboutPage_SML.jpg)

![About MED](assets/images/AboutPage/AboutPage_MED.jpg)

![About LRG](assets/images/AboutPage/AboutPage_LRG.jpg)

**NavBar**

Our NavBar will change once someone is logged in or out, and will also be highlighted to the person on what page they are currently on. We have also made the NavBar collapsible on smaller screens.

**Home Page**

![Wireframe Home](assets/images/CalendarPage/CalendarPage_Wireframe.jpg)

This is our main landing page, where the user can see their calendar, switch between months, and check their tasks on a given day.

We made sure to highlight the current day in green so the user knows what day it is. We also included the tasks on a given day to read “one task today” or “two tasks today” or however many. On the smaller screens, we did notice that this was too cramped, so instead, we grayed out the days that had events on them.

We also have our task view at the bottom of the page, which includes icons for view, edit, delete, and mark as complete/incomplete (which will go to their completed tasks on the profile page).

We also included an add task to this component and the user will be taken to add a task on that day, as opposed to the add task button on the top left, which will go to a task for that day.

![Home SML](assets/images/CalendarPage/CalendarPage_SML.jpg)

![Home MED](assets/images/CalendarPage/CalendarPage_MED.jpg)

![Home LRG](assets/images/CalendarPage/CalendarPage_LRG.jpg)

**Create Task**

![Wireframe Create Task](assets/images/CreateTaskPage/CreateTask_Wireframe.jpg)

Here we have our create task page. The user can add a title and pick amongst other details of their task. We included a date picker for the date of the task and we also included some error handling if the user chooses to create a task in the past.

![Create Task SML](assets/images/CreateTaskPage/CreateTask_SML.jpg)

![Create Task MED](assets/images/CreateTaskPage/CreateTask_MED.jpg)

![Create Task LRG](assets/images/CreateTaskPage/CreateTask_LRG.jpg)

**View Task**

![Wireframe View Task](assets/images/ViewTaskPage/ViewTask_Wireframe.jpg)

We added a view task page for this app so the user can check for more information about their task, like description, category, or type of task. We made this read-only, just in case the user might change something and not realize.

![View Task SML](assets/images/ViewTaskPage/ViewTask_SML.jpg)

![View Task MED](assets/images/ViewTaskPage/ViewTask_MED.jpg)

![View Task LRG](assets/images/ViewTaskPage/ViewTask_LRG.jpg)

**Edit Task**

![Wireframe Edit Task](assets/images/EditTaskPage/EditTaskPage_Wireframe.jpg)

This page is quite similar to the create task page for layout. We have also included error handling to make sure the user actually wants to update a task, and an additional warning so they know they are changing a task to be in the past.

![Edit Task SML](assets/images/EditTaskPage/EditTaskPage_SML.jpg)

![Edit Task MED](assets/images/EditTaskPage/EditTaskPage_MED.jpg)

![Edit Task LRG](assets/images/EditTaskPage/EditTaskPage_LRG.jpg)

**Profile**

![Wireframe Profile](assets/images/ProfilePage/ProfilePage_Wireframe.jpg)

Here we give the user a chance to look at their profile. They can change their image, their bio, and look at their completed tasks so far. We’ve also included an edit profile section alongside a rewards page.

![Profile SML](assets/images/ProfilePage/ProfilePage_SML.jpg)

![Profile MED](assets/images/ProfilePage/ProfilePage_MED.jpg)

![Profile LRG](assets/images/ProfilePage/ProfilePage_LRG.jpg)

**Edit Profile**

![Wireframe Profile Edit](assets/images/EditProfilePage/EditProfile_Wireframe.jpg)

Here we have kept the form simple, and users can upload their image or change their bio on this screen.

![Profile Edit SML](assets/images/EditProfilePage/EditProfile_SML.jpg)

![Profile Edit MED](assets/images/EditProfilePage/EditProfile_MED.jpg)

![Profile Edit LRG](assets/images/EditProfilePage/EditProfile_LRG.jpg)

**Rewards Page**

![Wireframe Rewards SML](assets/images/RewardsPage/RewardsPage_SML_Wireframe.jpg)

![Wireframe Rewards MED](assets/images/RewardsPage/RewardsPage_MED_Wireframe.jpg)

![Wireframe Rewards LRG](assets/images/RewardsPage/RewardsPage_LRG_Wireframe.jpg)

We included a simple rewards page to keep the user engaged and give them something to work towards. The rewards are locked and gray until the user completes the task, after which the color appears. We went for bright colors to keep the user enthusiastic. One of the challenges is to never have an overdue task, so we added this to always keep the user interested.

![Rewards SML](assets/images/RewardsPage/RewardsPage_SML.jpg)

![Rewards MED](assets/images/RewardsPage/RewardsPage_MED.jpg)

![Rewards LRG](assets/images/RewardsPage/RewardsPage_LRG.jpg)

### Other Features of Our Application

The main features of this application are to let users see their whole month in front of them so they know what they have coming up. We created the page in a way that is user-friendly and easy to understand.

We have also included the icons for viewing, editing, and deleting to give the app more of a well-developed feel, which we hope will interest the user, as well as the checkbox, which will prompt up a small “task complete/incomplete” when the user ticks it.

We also put a line through the task if it is complete so the user has another way to identify that their task is complete.

![Complete, Crossed Out Task Notification](assets/images/Taskcomplete/testing_task_complete.jpg)

![Incomplete, Task Notification](assets/images/Taskcomplete/testing_task_incomplete.jpg)


### Future Features

**Developing Tasks**

We would like to add more in-depth analysis for users when they go to look through past tasks, possibly filtering by type or task, or by name. We would also like to give the option of attaching a picture or file to a task.

**Adding Friends**

We would also like to give the chance to follow friends and share tasks with them.

**More Rewards**

We would like to increase the types of rewards and the ways in which they’re given, possibly adding a trophy room where users can see all the rewards they’ve earned, and also giving them a chance to compete with friends for certain rewards.

**Connect to Other Apps**

We would like to be able to connect to someone's social media or Facebook and be easily reachable from there if they need to add a task or invite a friend to a task.

## Design

We went with a light design with some other bright colors splashed in for this project. The reason for this is we want people to feel energized and engaged while using this application, and the bright color reflects someone who is more energetic, as opposed to a darker background which might not evoke too much energy. As mentioned before, we would like to add a dark mode for those users who want it.

## Bugs

### Fixed Bugs

#### Overdue Count
Initially, the overdue count was calculated entirely on the frontend. However, we encountered a persistent bug that broke the code. After extensive debugging, we decided to handle most of the overdue count logic in the backend, with some assistance from the frontend. We also faced another bug where the frontend couldn't interpret the backend data due to it being sent in the wrong format. This issue was resolved by ensuring the data was transmitted in the correct format.

#### Year Format
We encountered a bug where the frontend wasn't sending the task date in the correct format. Through debugging, we discovered the mismatch between how the backend processed dates and how the frontend handled them. We fixed this by aligning the date format between the backend and frontend.

#### Changing Profile Picture
There was an issue with uploading profile pictures to Cloudinary. After reviewing the settings in `settings.py`, we identified an error in our API key configuration, which caused the images not to be sent correctly. Once the API key issue was corrected, the uploads worked as expected.

### Current Bugs

#### Websocket
We are currently experiencing an issue where the console logs a message every minute while the application is idle, indicating that a websocket is not connecting. However, this does not appear to impact the application's functionality. We plan to address this bug in the future.

![Websocked Bug](assets/images/Final_images/websocket_bug.jpg)

#### Babel Plugin
We receive a warning in our terminal about needing to update a Babel plugin. We previously attempted to make this change, but it completely broke the application. We will work on resolving this issue in the future.


## Entity-Relationship Diagram

The ER (Entity-Relationship) diagram represents the relationships between the three main models in the Django backend: `User`, `Profile`, and `Task`. 

### Relationships

- **User to Profile: One-to-One (1:1)**
  - The `User` model, provided by Django's authentication system, has a One-to-One relationship with the `Profile` model. This means that each user in the system has one and only one profile, which contains additional information such as a bio and profile image.

- **User to Task: One-to-Many (1:N)**
  - The `User` model has a One-to-Many relationship with the `Task` model. This allows each user to create multiple tasks, where each task is associated with a specific user. The `Task` model includes attributes such as the task title, description, start date, completion status, priority, and category, enabling users to manage and organize their tasks effectively.

The relationships between these models ensure that the system can manage user profiles and tasks in a scalable and organized manner.

![ER Diagram](assets/images/DatabseER/database_diagram.jpg)

## Django Backend Overview

The backend of this application is built using Python and the Django framework. The backend defines three main models: `User`, `Profile`, and `Task`. Each model supports full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, enabling users to create and manage their profiles and tasks efficiently. The `User` model, provided by Django's authentication system, handles authentication and associations with both `Profile` and `Task` models.

### Models and Access Control

- **Profile and Task Models**: 
  - The `Profile` model is linked to the `User` model via a One-to-One relationship, storing additional user information such as a bio and profile image.
  - The `Task` model is linked to the `User` model via a One-to-Many relationship, allowing each user to create and manage multiple tasks. Each task contains attributes like title, description, start date, completion status, priority, and category.
  - Additionally, the `Task` model includes an `overdue` boolean value, which is set to `True` if the current date has passed the task's start date without the task being marked as completed. Tasks also have a `completed` boolean value that indicates whether or not the task has been finished. These fields help users track their task progress and manage overdue tasks effectively.

### Access Control

- **Superuser Access**: 
  - The superuser, who is created during the Django setup, has full access to all profiles and tasks in the system. This allows the superuser to view, edit, and delete any user’s profile or task, providing complete administrative control over the backend.

- **Standard User Access**: 
  - Apart from the superuser, standard users can only access their own profiles and tasks. Users are restricted from accessing or modifying the profiles and tasks of other users. This access control is enforced by Django’s authentication and permission system, ensuring that user data remains secure and private.

## Deployment Guide: React Frontend with Django Backend on Heroku

This guide outlines the steps to deploy your full-stack application, which includes a React frontend and a Django backend, to Heroku. The React frontend communicates with the Django backend via Axios.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following:
- A [Heroku](https://heroku.com) account
- Heroku CLI installed
- Git installed
- Node.js and Python installed on your machine
- A PostgreSQL database (Heroku provides one in production)

### 1. Set Up Your Django Backend for Deployment

1. Install necessary packages, such as Gunicorn (for serving your Django app) and Whitenoise (for handling static files).
2. Update the `settings.py` file:
   - Configure `ALLOWED_HOSTS` for production.
   - Set up static file handling using Whitenoise.
   - Configure the database to use PostgreSQL in production (use `dj-database-url`).
3. Create a `Procfile` in the root directory to specify the command to run your application (e.g., using Gunicorn).
4. Add env.py file to your gitignore so any secret keys aren't shared.
5. Collect static files for production.

### 2. Set Up Your React Frontend for Deployment

1. In your React project, update the Axios base URL to point to the production Django backend API.
2. Build the React project using `npm run build` or `yarn build`. This generates static files for deployment.
3. Ensure your React app is configured to handle routing properly on Heroku (e.g., using `BrowserRouter`).

### 3. Prepare for Deployment on Heroku

1. Create a Heroku app using the Heroku CLI:  
   ```bash
   heroku create your-app-name


## Why React is Best Suited for This Application

This application leverages React's powerful component-based architecture, making it an ideal choice for the project. React allows us to efficiently break down the UI into reusable components, which can be used across different parts of the application. This promotes modularity, simplifies development, and makes the codebase more maintainable and scalable. React's ability to manage state and efficiently update the DOM with its virtual DOM capabilities ensures that the application remains responsive and performant even as complexity grows.

By using React, we can ensure that each part of the UI, from task displays to calendar views, is well-structured and can be easily updated or extended in the future. This aligns with the project's goals of providing a dynamic, user-friendly, and feature-rich experience.

### Reusable Components

The application consists of several reusable components, each serving a distinct purpose within the UI. Below is a list of the key reusable components implemented in the application:

### 1. **Task List**
   - **Description:** A component responsible for displaying a list of tasks.
   - **Reusability:** This component can be reused to display tasks across different pages, such as in the dashboard, specific project views, or in daily task overviews.

### 2. **Task Item**
   - **Description:** A single task item within the task list, showing details like task name, due date, and status.
   - **Reusability:** This component is used by the `TaskList` component and can be customized or extended to fit different types of tasks (e.g., with subtasks or priority markers).

### 3. **Calendar**
   - **Description:** Displays a monthly calendar view.
   - **Reusability:** This component can be reused in different sections of the application, such as on the main dashboard or within specific project or team views to provide a consistent calendar interface.

### 4. **Event Item**
   - **Description:** Represents an individual event displayed on the calendar.
   - **Reusability:** This component can be reused across different calendar views (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) and customized to display different types of events.

### 5. **Form Input**
   - **Description:** A form input component for entering or editing task or event details.
   - **Reusability:** This is a highly reusable component that can be used for various forms throughout the application, such as creating or editing tasks, events, profiles.

### 6. **Button**
   - **Description:** A generic button component used across the application.
   - **Reusability:** This component can be reused in any part of the application that requires user interaction, such as form submissions, navigation actions, or toggling UI elements.

### 7. **Modal**
   - **Description:** A modal component for displaying popup dialogs, such as task or event creation forms.
   - **Reusability:** The modal can be reused for various purposes, such as confirming actions, displaying forms, or providing additional information to the user without navigating away from the current page.

### 8. **Navbar**
   - **Description:** A navigation bar component for navigating between different sections of the application.
   - **Reusability:** The navbar can be reused across all pages of the application, ensuring consistent navigation and branding.

By building the application with these reusable components, we ensure a consistent user experience and make it easier to maintain and extend the codebase over time.

## Backend Testing

### Access Control Testing

We conducted a series of tests to ensure that access control is properly enforced on both the profiles and tasks endpoints. These tests were designed to verify that users cannot access data unless they are authenticated and that they can only view their own data once logged in.

#### 1. Access Without Authentication
- **Test Description**: Attempted to access the `/profiles` and `/tasks` endpoints without being logged in.
- **Expected Outcome**: The system should return a 401 Unauthorized response, blocking access to these resources.
- **Result**: As expected, the system successfully blocked access, returning the appropriate 401 status code.

![Profiles with no access](assets/images/Final_images/backend_unable_to_see_profiles_not_loggedin.jpg)


#### 2. Access With Authentication
- **Test Description**: Logged in as a user and attempted to access the `/profiles` and `/tasks` endpoints.
- **Expected Outcome**: The user should only be able to view their own profile and tasks.
- **Result**: Upon authentication, the system allowed access to the user's profile and tasks, but no other users' data was accessible.
